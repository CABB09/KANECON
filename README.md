# KANECON
In this project, the KAN network was implemented to predict the "High, Low, Close and Open" characteristics of the AMZN, GOOG and AAPL stock markets. It was compared against an ANN network and another CNN, following the methodology of the article "Stock market prediction using deep learning algorithms".

The above was to prepare my project for the subject "Neural Networks". It was developed as a postgraduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidad Veracruzana.

I recommend that you read the pdf "Proyecto_Redes_NeuronalesCABB" to understand what was done, what was the structure of the networks, what data was used and what were the results
